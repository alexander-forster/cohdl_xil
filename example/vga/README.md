This directory contains a more advanced example design. It reads ascii codes from UART and displays the corresponding characters on a VGA screen.

* `vga_impl/vga.py`

    defines a reusable VGA class that drives the color and sync signals
* `vga_impl/FONTS`

    Contains bit masks for a number of terminal fonts. These files (and many more) can be found [here](https://github.com/viler-int10h/vga-text-mode-fonts).
* `vga_impl/font_reader.py`

    Reads character bit masks from files in the `FONTS` directory and turns them into an CoHDL array of BitVectors.

* `vga_impl/vga_text.py`

    Uses the functions provided by `vga.py` and the bitmask array generated by `font_reader.py` to turn ASCII sequences into characters on the VGA screen.

* `vga_ascii_uart.py`

    Uses `vga_impl` and the Xilinx AXI UART IP core to forward received ASCII cores to the VGA screen.
